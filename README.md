# Weather history

Sometimes you don't remember if it was sunny or cloudy the day before. Or maybe the air pressure changed too rapidly 17 hours ago and you've got a headache. Or maybe it was too humid and windy 3 days ago and youâ€™ve caught a cold. Whatever the reason is, it might be fun to log and visualize the weather data.

## The data

Use https://openweathermap.org/current API to get and log the current weather data. You are free to choose the type of data to log and visualize (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind etc). The location and the logging interval is up to you as well. 

## Your task

Your task is to create a visualization of the weather history data. Return your task as code ([github](https://www.github.com) repository address preferred) and a webpage from which we can see your visualization of the data.

## Hints

* If you have no idea what to do, you might want to use a simple cloud service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
* To log the weather history and to visualize it, you will probably need a simple database.
* Our magic words are [react](https://reactjs.org/), [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/), but don't want limit your selected tech stack in any way.
